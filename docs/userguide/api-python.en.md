</pre>

## 1. Example

First, a simple example is shown.

This example uses two services, namely `service-1` and `service-2`, each with a different messaging system as its backend.
The backend of `service-1` is Apache Kafka, which consists of four brokers, namely `kafka-1` thru `kafka-4`.
The backend of `service-2` is MQTT, which consists of one broker, `192.168.2.105`.

### Creating a configuration file

The configuration file contains settings for the clients to connect to the broker.
Please refer to the [Configuration file](config.en.md) for details.

In this example, we create the following configuration file `.sinetstream_config.yml` in the current directory on the client machine.

```
service-1:
  type: kafka
  brokers:
    - kafka-1:9092
    - kafka-2:9092
    - kafka-3:9092
    - kafka-4:9092
service-2:
  type: mqtt
  brokers: 192.168.2.105:1883
  username_pw_set:
    username: user01
    password: pass01
```

### Sending Messages

The following code sends two messages to the topic `topic-1` of the messaging system associated with the service `service-1`.

```python
from sinetstream import MessageWriter

writer = MessageWriter('service-1', 'topic-1')
with writer as f:
    f.publish(b'Hello! This is the 1st message.')
    f.publish(b'Hello! This is the 2nd message.')
```

First, create an instance of the MessageWriter object by specifying the service name and the topic name.
Open this instance with a `with` statement and send messages to the broker by invoking the `publish()` method in the block.

> The MessageWriter object automatically connects to the messaging system when entering the `with` block, and
> it automatically closes the connection when exiting the `with` block.

By default, the argument of `publish()` is a byte sequence.
To transfer an object other than a byte sequence, specify value_type or value_serializer in the constructor of the [MessageWriter Class](#messagewriter-class).

### Receiving Messages

The following code receives messages from the topic `topic-1` of the messaging system associated with the service `service-1`.

```python
from sinetstream import MessageReader

reader = MessageReader('service-1', 'topic-1')
with reader as f:
    for msg in f:
        print(msg.value)
```

First, create an instance of the MessageReader object by specifying the service name and the topic name.
Open this instance with a `with` statement, loop the iterator for `f` in the block, and receive messages from the broker by referring to the `value` property of the iterator.

> The MessageReader object automatically connects to the messaging system when entering the `with` block, and
> it automatically closes the connection when exiting the `with` block.

By default, the message reader process does not time out and the `for` statement becomes an infinite loop.
To exit the `for` loop, specify the `receive_timeout_ms` parameter in the constructor of the [MessageReader class](#messagereader-class) or perform a signal handling.

'publish(message)' is an asynchronous process and returns a promise object of promise.
By using the methods '.then()' and '.catch()' of the Promise object,
It is possible to set processing according to the transmission result (success or failure).
A usage example is shown as below.

```python
with AsyncMessageWriter('service-1') as writer:
    writer.publish("message 1").then(lambda _: print("success")).catch(lambda _: print("failure"))
```

##### Exception

    * The type of message does not match 'value_type' or the function specified by 'value_serializer'.
* AuthorizationError
    * Tried to send messages to an unauthorized topic.

Depending on the messaging system, even if an unauthorized operation is performed, an AuthorizationError Exception may not occur in the following cases:

1. When using MQTT (Mosquitto)
    * Because the MQTT broker raises no error for unauthorized operation.
2. When using Kafka with 'Consistency' set to 'AT_MOST_ONCE'
    * Because the client does not wait for a response from the broker after sending a message.
      Therefore, the client cannot detect an error on the broker side.

### 2.5 Message class

The wrapper class for the message object provided by the messaging system.

#### Property

All the properties are read only.

* value
    * The payload of the message (given by `Raw.value` for Kafka and `raw.payload` for MQTT).
    * By default, a byte sequence is obtained.
    * The type of `value` depends on the `value_type` parameter or the `value_deserializer` function specified in MessageWriter.
        * If `value_type` is `"byte_array"` (default), the type is `bytes`.
        * If `value_type` is `"text"`, the type is `str`.
        * If `value_deserializer` is specified, an object converted by this function is obtained.
* topic
    * The topic name.
* timestamp
    * The time the message was sent (UNIX time)
         * Unit: second
         * Type: float
    * `0` indicates no time is set
* timestamp_us
    * The time the message was sent (UNIX time)
         * Unit: microsecond
         * Type: int
    * `0` indicates no time is set
* raw
    * The message object provided by the messaging system.

### 2.6 Metrics Class

Metrics class
You can get metrics information by referencing the metrics property for Reader/Writer objects.
After close() Reader/Writer objects, you can get metrics information when it is closed (but raw is None).

* MessageReader.metrics
* MessageWriter.metrics
* AsyncMessageReader.metrics
* AsyncMessageWriter.metrics

The Reader/Writer metrics are reset when the reset_metrics() method was called from the Reader/Writer class.
If the `reset_raw` argument is set to True, the metrics of the backend messaging system will also be reset if possible.

* MessageReader.reset_metrics(reset_raw=False)
* MessageWriter.reset_metrics(reset_raw=False)
* AsyncMessageReader.reset_metrics(reset_raw=False)
* AsyncMessageWriter.reset_metrics(reset_raw=False)

> Eclipse Paho, an MQTT client library used in the SINETStream MQTT plugin, does not provide metrics collection capability.
> The Kafka client library has the capability, but does not provide the reset function.

The metrics are measured at the boundary of the SINETStream main library and the specified messaging system plugin.
Therefore, a stream of encrypted massages will be measured if the data encryption function provided by SINETStream is used.

        * The unit of the time_ms is milliseconds.
    * = end_time - start_time
* msg_count_total
    * int
    * The cumulative number of messages sent and received.
* msg_count_rate
    * float
    * The rate of the number of messages sent and received.

    * int
    * The Cumulative amount of messages sent and received in bytes.
* msg_bytes_rate
    * float
    * The rate of the amount of messages sent and received.
    * = msg_bytes_total / time
    * return 0 if time is 0.

    * int
    * The minimum size of messages sent and received in bytes.
* msg_size_avg
    * float
    * The average size of messages sent and received in bytes.

    * int
    * The maximum size of messages sent and received in bytes.
* error_count_total
    * int
    * The cumulative number of errors.

Display the number of received messages and its amount in bytes:

```python
from sinetstream import MessageReader

reader = MessageReader('service-1', 'topic-001')
# (1)
with reader as f:
    for msg in f:
        pass
    m = reader.metrics  # Statistics on the accumulation from (1)
    print(f'COUNT: {m.msg_count_total}')
    print(f'BYTES: {m.msg_bytes_total}')
```

Display the receive rate for every 10 messages:

```python
from sinetstream import MessageReader

reader = MessageReader('service-1', 'topic-001')
with reader as f:
    count = 0
    for msg in f:
        count += 1
        if (count == 10):
            count = 0
            m = reader.metrics
            reader.reset_metrics()
            print(f'COUNT/s: {m.msg_count_rate}')
            print(f'BYTES/s: {m.msg_bytes_rate}')
```

## 3. Messaging system-specific parameters

`kwargs` can be used to transparently pass parameters to the backend messaging system.
The actual parameters that can be passed depend on the backend.
No validation is performed.

### 3.1 Apache Kafka

Basically, the constructor arguments to
[KafkaConsumer](https://kafka-python.readthedocs.io/en/master/apidoc/KafkaConsumer.html) and
[KafkaProducer](https://kafka-python.readthedocs.io/en/master/apidoc/KafkaProducer.html) of
[kafka-python](https://kafka-python.readthedocs.io/en/master/) can be specified as parameters.
If the parameter is valid only in `KafkaConsumer` or `KafkaProducer`, it affects `MessageReader` or `MessageWriter`, respectively.

[Kafka-specific parameters](config-kafka.en.md)

### 3.2 MQTT (Eclipse Paho)

Basically, the constructor arguments and the setter function (`XXX_set`) arguments of
[paho.mqtt.client.Client](https://www.eclipse.org/paho/clients/python/docs/#client)
can be specified as parameters.
