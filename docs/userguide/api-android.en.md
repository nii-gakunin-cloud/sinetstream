## Class SinetStreamReader

* Provides a set of API functions to be a Reader (= subscriber) in the SINETStream system.
* Due to the nature of messaging system, all methods listed below should be handled as asynchronous requests.
    * initialize
    * terminate
* User of this class must implement the `SinetStreamReader.SinetStreamReaderListener` in the calling [Activity](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/intro-activities), so that the result of an asynchronous request or any error condition can be notified.


### Nested Class Summary
* SinetStreamReader.SinetStreamReaderListener
    * static interface


### Constructor Summary
* SinetStreamReader
    * Constructs a SinetStreamReader instance.


### Method Summary
* initialize
    * Connects to the broker and prepares oneself as a subscriber.
* terminate
    * Disconnects from the broker and cleans up allocated resources.


### Constructor Detail

```
public SinetStreamReader(@NonNull
                         android.content.Context context)
```

* Description:
    * Constructs a SinetStreamReader instance.
* Parameters:
    * context - the Application [context](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context) which implements `SinetStreamReader.SinetStreamReaderListener`, usually it is the calling Activity itself.
* Throws:
    * java.lang.RuntimeException - if given context does not implement the required listener.

### Method Detail
#### initialize

```
public void initialize(@NonNull
                       java.lang.String serviceName)
```

* Description:
    * Connects to the broker and prepares oneself as a subscriber.
    * Connection parameters will be specified by external configuration file.<br/>
      See [Configuration files](config.en.md) for details.
* Parameters:
    * serviceName - the service name to match configuration parameters.

#### terminate

```
public void terminate()
```

* Descripton:
    * Disconnects from the broker and cleans up allocated resources.


## Class SinetStreamWriter

* Provides a set of API functions to be a Writer (= publisher) in the SINETStream system.
* Due to the nature of messaging system, all methods listed below should be handled as asynchronous requests.
    * initialize
    * terminate
    * publish
* User of this class must implement the `SinetStreamWriter.SinetStreamWriterListener` in the calling [Activity](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/intro-activities), so that the result of an asynchronous request or any error condition can be notified.

### Nested Class Summary
