# How to create a certificate with a private certificate authority

## Overview

This page describes how to create a certificate required for SSL/TLS connection with a private certificate authority (CA).

The description will be made in the following order.

1. Prerequisites
1. Build a private certificate authority
1. Create a server certificate
1. Create a client certificate

## Prerequisites

The following conditions are assumed for simplicity in this document.

* A private CA is running on CentOS 7
* The certificate created by the private CA is in PEM format

The following values are used in the examples.
> In practice, use appropriate values for your environment.

* Private CA
    * OpenSSL configuration file
        * /etc/pki/tls/openssl.cnf
    * Directory for related files
        * /etc/pki/CA
* Certificates
    * CA certificate
        * Certificate file path
            * /etc/pki/CA/cacert.pem
        * Private key file path
            * /etc/pki/CA/private/cakey.pem
        * Subject
            * /C=JP/ST=Example_State/O=Example_Organization/CN=private-ca
        * Validity period (in days)
            * 3650
    * Server certificate of the broker
        * Certificate file path
            * /etc/pki/CA/certs/broker.crt
        * Private key file path
            * /etc/pki/CA/private/broker.key
        * Subject
            * /C=JP/CN=broker.example.org
    * Client certificate
        * Certificate file path
            * /etc/pki/CA/certs/client0.crt
        * Private key file path
            * /etc/pki/CA/private/client0.key
        * Subject
            * /C=JP/CN=client0

## Build a private certificate authority

Here we show how to build a private certificate authority (CA) on CentOS 7.

> The private certificate authority does not necessarily need to be built on the machine running the broker.

Install the `openssl` package.
> Skip it if it is already installed.

```bash
$ sudo yum -y install openssl
```

Create a directory to store certificates and private keys.

```bash
$ sudo mkdir -p /etc/pki/CA/certs /etc/pki/CA/crl /etc/pki/CA/newcerts /etc/pki/CA/private
```

Edit the OpenSSL configuration file.

* unique_subject
    * Specify `no` to simplify CA certificate rollover
* copy_extensions
    * Specify `copy` to allow certificate request to copy SAN (subjectAltName)

Edit the `[ CA_default ]` section of `openssl.cnf` as follows.

> From the default `openssl.cnf`, just remove the comment symbol `#` before `unique_subject` and `copy_extensions`.

```
[ CA_default ]
(omit)
unique_subject  = no                    # Set to 'no' to allow creation of
                                        # several ctificates with same subject.
(omit)
# Extension copying option: use with caution.
copy_extensions = copy
```

Create a file named `index.txt` to record the certificate signed by the private CA.

```bash
$ sudo touch /etc/pki/CA/index.txt
```

Create a CSR and private key for the CA certificate.

```bash
$ sudo openssl req -new -keyout /etc/pki/CA/private/cakey.pem \
       -out /etc/pki/CA/careq.pem -nodes \
       -subj /C=JP/ST=Example_State/O=Example_Organization/CN=private-ca
```

Create a self-signed CA certificate.

```bash
$ sudo openssl ca -batch -in /etc/pki/CA/careq.pem -selfsign -extensions v3_ca \
       -keyfile /etc/pki/CA/private/cakey.pem -days 3650 -create_serial \
       -out /etc/pki/CA/cacert.pem
```

Check the content of the created CA certificate.

```bash
$ openssl x509 -in /etc/pki/CA/cacert.pem -noout -text
```

The output should look like this:

```
Certificate:
    Data:
        Version: 3 (0x2)
        Serial Number:
            ef:f1:65:60:87:be:24:2d
    Signature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption
        Issuer: C=JP, ST=Example_State, O=Example_Organization, CN=private-ca
        Validity
            Not Before: Feb 01 00:00:00 2020 GMT
            Not After : Jan 31 00:00:00 2023 GMT
        Subject: C=JP, ST=Default_Organization, O=Default_Organization, CN=private-ca
(omit)
        X509v3 extensions:
            X509v3 Subject Key Identifier:
                73:16:96:F1:00:79:31:FE:16:FD:73:C7:E7:C9:99:02:7D:0C:50:68
            X509v3 Authority Key Identifier:
                keyid:73:16:96:F1:00:79:31:FE:16:FD:73:C7:E7:C9:99:02:7D:0C:50:68

            X509v3 Basic Constraints:
                CA:TRUE
(omit)
```

## Create a server certificate

Add the following lines to `openssl.cnf` to add the server's hostname to the SAN (subjectAltName) of the  certificate.
> Change the hostname after `DNS = ` according to your environment.

```
(omit)
[ req ]
(omit)
req_extensions = v3_req
(omit)
[ v3_req ]
subjectAltName = @alt_names
(omit)
[ alt_names ]
DNS = broker.example.org
```

Create a certificate signing request (CSR) and a private key for server certificate using the following command.
Specify the output filename of the private key after `-keyout`, the output filename of the CSR after `-out`, and the subject of certificate after `-subj`.

```bash
$ sudo openssl req -new -keyout /etc/pki/CA/private/broker.key \
       -out /etc/pki/CA/broker.csr -nodes -subj /C=JP/CN=broker.example.org
```

Create a server certificate using the following command.
Specify the private key filename after `-keyfile`, the CA certificate filename after `-cert`, the CSR filename after `-in`, and the output filename of the server certificate after `-out`.

```bash
$ sudo openssl ca -batch -keyfile /etc/pki/CA/private/cakey.pem \
      -cert /etc/pki/CA/cacert.pem -in /etc/pki/CA/broker.csr \
      -out /etc/pki/CA/certs/broker.crt -policy policy_anything
```

Check the content of the created server certificate.

```bash
$ openssl x509 -in /etc/pki/CA/certs/broker.crt -noout -text
```

The output should look like this:

```
Certificate:
    Data:
        Version: 3 (0x2)
        Serial Number:
            ef:f1:65:60:87:be:24:2e
    Signature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption
        Issuer: C=JP, ST=Example_State, O=Example_Organization, CN=private-ca
        Validity
            Not Before: Feb 01 00:00:00 2020 GMT
            Not After : Jan 31 00:00:00 2023 GMT
        Subject: C=JP, CN=broker
(omit)
        X509v3 extensions:
            X509v3 Basic Constraints:
                CA:FALSE
(omit)
            X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:
                DNS:broker.example.org
(omit)
```

## Create a client certificate

Create a certificate signing request (CSR) and a private key for client certificate using the following command.
Specify the output filename of the private key after `-keyout`, the output filename of the CSR after `-out`, and the subject of certificate after `-subj`.

```bash
$ sudo openssl req -new -keyout /etc/pki/CA/private/client0.key \
       -out /etc/pki/CA/client0.csr -nodes -subj /C=JP/CN=client0
```

Create a client certificate using the following command.
Specify the private key filename after `-keyfile`, the CA certificate filename after `-cert`, the CSR filename after `-in`, and the output filename of the client certificate after `-out`.

```bash
$ sudo openssl ca -batch -keyfile /etc/pki/CA/private/cakey.pem \
      -cert /etc/pki/CA/cacert.pem -in /etc/pki/CA/client0.csr \
      -out /etc/pki/CA/certs/client0.crt -policy policy_anything
```

Check the content of the created client certificate.

```bash
$ openssl x509 -in /etc/pki/CA/certs/client0.crt -noout -text
```

The output should look like this:

```
Certificate:
    Data:
        Version: 3 (0x2)
        Serial Number:
            ef:f1:65:60:87:be:24:2f
    Signature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption
        Issuer: C=JP, ST=Example_State, O=Example_Organization, CN=private-ca
        Validity
            Not Before: Feb 01 00:00:00 2020 GMT
            Not After : Jan 31 00:00:00 2023 GMT
        Subject: C=JP, CN=client0
(omit)
```
