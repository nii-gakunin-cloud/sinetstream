## The configuration example of Kafka

When compressing a batch of records with gzip using the Kafka's function, set the `compression_type` parameter as follows.
(It is only necessary to specify `compression_type` on the Writer side)

```
service-kafka:
  type: kafka
  brokers:
    - kafka0.example.org:9092
  compression_type: gzip
```
