## What is SINETStream

It is required to collect data from sensors and other devices distributed over a wide area network without loss for reliable analysis in such research areas as environmental measurement, biological observation, and Internet of things (IoT).
However, advanced knowledge and skills about networking are required to develop a program that collects and analyzes data distributed over a wide area network.
It is difficult for average researchers who want to focus on their own research topics.
SINETStream is a software package that makes it easy for researchers to reliably collect and analyze data via wide area networks without loss.
SINETStream provides such functions as follows:

* Write data collected from sensors etc. to cloud servers or to on-premises servers in universities etc.
* Read the data stored in the servers into your analysis program.

A researcher can easily develop his/her own programs that collect and analyze data distributed over a wide area network using the SINETStream API.
Research data may contain sensitive information.
SINETStream also supports authentication of sensor devices and encryption of data and communication to enable a secure data collection.
